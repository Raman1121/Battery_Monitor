# Battery_Monitor

In order to ensure a longer life for your battery, it is said that the battery level should be maintained between 20-90%.
So, this script monitors the battery level of your laptop and sends a Desktop Notification if the battery level drops below 20% or exceeds 90%.

Save this script inside **/etc/rc.local** directory and it will automatically monitor your battery level.
